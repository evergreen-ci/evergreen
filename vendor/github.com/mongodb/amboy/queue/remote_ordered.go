// SimpleRemoteOrdered queue implements the amboy.Queue interface and

// this implementation evaluates and respects dependencies, unlike the
// RemoteUnordered implementation which executes all tasks.
//
// The term simple differentiates from a queue that schedules tasks in
// order based on reported edges, which may be more efficient with
// more complex dependency graphs. Internally SimpleRemoteOrdered and
// RemoteUnordred share an implementation *except* for the Next method,
// which differs in task dispatching strategies.

// jobs that are Ready to run, it dispatches them immediately.
