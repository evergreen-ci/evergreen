``jasper`` -- Process Management Service
========================================

Overview
--------

Jasper is a library for managing groups of processes in the context of
test automation, and is a component of `Evergreen
<https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen>`_ and related tools.

Documentation
-------------

The core API documentation is in the `godoc
<https://godoc.org/github.com/mongodb/jasper/>`_.

Until there's documentation of the REST and gRPC interfaces, you can use
the `rest interface declaration
<https://github.com/mongodb/jasper/blob/master/rest_service.go#L39>`_
and the `proto file
<https://github.com/mongodb/jasper/blob/master/jasper.proto>`_.
