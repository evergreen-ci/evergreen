# Contributing
Pull requests to improve Evergreen are always welcome! To get started contributing, please follow these steps:

1. Sign the [contributor's agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/contributor). This will allow us to review and accept
   contributions.
2. Evergreen uses [Jira](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/EVG) to track work. If you're contributing a new change
   that's not already tracked in an existing Jira ticket, file a ticket under the EVG project with a description of the
   intended changes.
3. Make the code changes and open a pull request. The pull request title should be prefixed with the Jira ticket number
   and include a brief summary of the changes. An Evergreen developer will review the code changes and run automated
   tests. If the change looks good, it will be merged.
