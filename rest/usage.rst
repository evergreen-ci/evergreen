Usage
===== 

General Functionality
=====================


Content Type and Communication
------------------------------
 The API accepts and returns all results in JSON. Some resources also allow 
URL parameters to provide additional specificity to a request.

Errors
------
 When an error is encountered during a request, the API returns a JSON 
object with the HTTP status code and a message describing the error of the form:

::

  {
   "status": <http_status_code>,
   "error": <error message>
  }

Pagination
----------
 API Routes that fetch many objects return them in a JSON array and support paging 
through subsets of the total result set. When there are additional results for the 
query, access to them is populated in a 'Links' HTTP header. This header has the form: 

::

 "Links" : <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="next"

 <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="prev"

Dates
-----

 Date fields are returned and accepted in ISO-8601 UTC extended format. They contain 
3 fractional seconds with a ‘dot’ separator. 

Empty Fields
------------

 A returned object will always contain its complete list of fields. Any field 
that does not have an associated value will be filled with JSON's null value. 

Resources
=========

The API has a series of implemented objects that it returns depending on the 
queried endpoint. 

Task
----

 The task is a basic unit of work understood by evergreen. They usually comprise 
a suite of tests or generation of a set of artifacts.
