Package model maps database models to API models for REST requests to the server.

Adding Models

Each model is kept in the model package of the REST v2 API in its own file. To
create a new model, define a struct containing all of the fields that it will
return and implement its two main methods BuildFromService and ToService. Be
sure to include struct tags to define the names the fields will have when
serialized to JSON.

Note that although it's generally recommended to implement some BuildFromService
and ToService methods to facilitate conversion between the REST and service
models, it's not necessary to implement the Model interface's exact method
definition (i.e. passing in interface{} and returning interface{}). The Model
interface is only necessary for a few special cases (e.g. reflection in admin
settings); for most REST models, it's much preferred to pass in the concrete
service model type and return the concrete service model type rather than pass
around interface{} and then type cast it into its expected type.

Guidelines for Creating Models

Include as much data as a user is likely to want when inspecting this resource.
This is likely to be more information than seems directly needed, but there is
little penalty to its inclusion.

Model Methods

The Model type is an interface with two methods.

				BuildFromService(in interface{}) error

BuildFromService fetches all needed data from the passed in object and sets them
on the model. BuildFromService may sometimes be called multiple times with different
types that all contain data to build up the model object. In this case, a type switch
is likely necessary to determine what has been passed in.

				ToService()(interface{}, error)

ToService creates an as-complete-as-possible version of the service layer's version
of this model. For example, if this is is a REST v2 Task model, the ToService method
creates a service layer Task and sets all of the fields it is able to and returns it.
