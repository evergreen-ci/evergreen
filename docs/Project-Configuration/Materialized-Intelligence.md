# Materialized Intelligence

Materialized Intelligence is R&D Developer Productivity's data offering for downstream analytics and business intelligence. We aim to provide a self-service platform for users to access and analyze data from Evergreen and other Dev Prod projects. This platform leverages [Mongo Trino](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/Introduction) and [Mongo Automated Reporting System](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/MARS/Introduction) (MARS) so that users can access any quantity of data without waiting on Dev Prod teams and without impacting production Dev Prod systems.

## Getting Started

### Mongo Trino Access
All Mongo engineers are automatically granted basic read access to Trino, see the [Internal Data Platform Security](https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/DW/Internal+Data+Platform+Security) documentation for more information. Access to the R&D Dev Prod data in Trino is governed through the [Internal Data Platform - Dev Prod Read](https://mana.corp.mongodbgov.com/guilds/61a43c5a210c1301d0b81297) MANA guild. Most engineering teams should have already been granted membership to this guildâ€”if you or your team does not have access, please request membership via MANA.

### Connecting to the Database
Check out the [Mongo Trino](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/Introduction) documentation and, more specifically, the [DBeaver Connection](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/DBeaver%20Connection) page to get started! Users are free to choose another database tool of their liking to connect and interact with Mongo Trino. See the [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSB9Xc7c7yrF7q4V_kWrJLw-8N4X5BNlT6S0xf-NdsY/edit?pli=1#heading=h.meqwpfqi1sn4) section for an exhaustive list of our data in Trino and example queries to get started!

## Data Dictionary
This section provides the most up-to-date description of our data sets in Trino, see the [Trino concepts documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/overview/concepts.html#schema) for more information on the terminology used. Data is exposed via well-designed views, see our [Data Policies](https://github.com/10gen/dev-prod-etls/blob/main/docs/policies.md) for more information. **Only the data sets exposed via a view and documented here are considered "production-ready", all others are considered "raw" and may be accessed at the peril of the user**.

### Evergreen Task Statistics
Daily aggregated statistics for task executions run in Evergreen. Tasks are aggregated by project ID, variant, task name, and the UTC date on which the task ran and partitioned by the project ID and date (in ISO format). For example, the partition `mongodb-mongo-master/2022-12-05` would contain the daily aggregated task stats for all tasks run on `2022-12-05` in the `mongodb-mongo-master` project. When running queries against this view it is highly recommended to always filter by project ID and date.

| Catalog        | Schema          | View                                       |
| ---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| awsdatacatalog | dev\_prod\_live | v\_\_evergreen\_\_daily\_task\_stats\_\_v1 |

#### Columns
| Name                         | Type    | Description |
|------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| project_id                   | VARCHAR | Unique project identifier.
| variant                      | VARCHAR | Name of the build variant on which the tasks ran.
| task\_name                   | VARCHAR | Display name of the tasks.
| request\_type                | VARCHAR | Name of the trigger that requested the task executions. Will always be one of: `patch_request`, `github_pull_request`, `gitter_request` (mainline), `trigger_request`, `merge_test` (commit queue), or `ad_hoc` (periodic build).
| finish\_date                 | VARCHAR | Date, in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`, on which the tasks ran.
| num\_success                 | BIGINT  | Number of successful task executions in the group.
| num\_failed                  | BIGINT  | Number of failed task executions in the group.
| num\_timed\_out              | BIGINT  | Number of task executions that failed due to a time out.
| num\_test\_failed            | BIGINT  | Number of task executions that failed due to a test failure.
| num\_system\_failed          | BIGINT  | Number of task executions that failed due to a system failure.
| num\_setup\_failed           | BIGINT  | Number of task executions that failed due to a setup failure.
| total\_success\_duration\_ns | BIGINT  | Total duration, in nanoseconds, of successful task executions.

### Evergreen Test Statistics
Daily aggregated statistics for test executions run in Evergreen. Test stats are aggregated by project, variant, task name, test name, request type, and the UTC date on which the test ran and partitioned by the project and date (in ISO format). For example, the partition `mongodb-mongo-master/2022-12-05` would contain the daily aggregated test stats for all tests run on `2022-12-05` in the `mongodb-mongo-master` project. When running queries against this view it is highly recommended to always filter by project and date.
