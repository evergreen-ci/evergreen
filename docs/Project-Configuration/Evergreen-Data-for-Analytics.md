# Evergreen Data for Analytics

We aim to provide a self-service platform for users to access and analyze data from Evergreen and other Dev Prod projects. Evergreen leverages [Mongo Trino](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/Introduction) and [Mongo Automated Reporting System](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/MARS/Introduction) (MARS) so that users can access any quantity of data without waiting on Dev Prod teams and without impacting production Dev Prod systems.

## Getting Started

### Mongo Trino Access

All Mongo engineers are automatically granted basic read access to Trino, see the [Internal Data Platform Security](https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/DW/Getting+Access+to+the+Internal+Data+Platform) documentation for more information. Access to the R&D Dev Prod data in Trino is governed through the [Internal Data Platform - Dev Prod Read](https://mana.corp.mongodbgov.com/guilds/61a43c5a210c1301d0b81297) MANA guild. Most engineering teams should have already been granted membership to this guildâ€”if you or your team does not have access, please request membership via MANA.

### Connecting to the Database

Check out the [Mongo Trino](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/Introduction) documentation and, more specifically, the [DBeaver Connection](https://docs.dataplatform.prod.corp.mongodb.com/docs/Trino/DBeaver%20Connection) page to get started! Users are free to choose another database tool of their liking to connect and interact with Mongo Trino. See the [Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary) section below for an exhaustive list of our data in Trino and example queries to get started!

## Data Dictionary

This section provides the most up-to-date description of our data sets in Trino, see the [Trino concepts documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/overview/concepts.html#schema) for more information on the terminology used. Data is exposed via well-designed views, see our [Data Policies](https://github.com/10gen/dev-prod-etls/blob/main/docs/policies.md) for more information. **Only the data sets exposed via a view and documented here are considered "production-ready", all others are considered "raw" and may be accessed at the peril of the user**.

### Evergreen Task Statistics

Daily aggregated statistics for task executions run in Evergreen. Tasks are aggregated by project ID, variant, task name, and the UTC date on which the task ran and partitioned by the project ID and date (in ISO format). For example, the partition `mongodb-mongo-master/2022-12-05` would contain the daily aggregated task stats for all tasks run on `2022-12-05` in the `mongodb-mongo-master` project. When running queries against this view it is highly recommended to always filter by project ID and date.

### Evergreen Test Statistics

Daily aggregated statistics for test executions run in Evergreen. Test stats are aggregated by project, variant, task name, test name, request type, and the UTC date on which the test ran and partitioned by the project and date (in ISO format). For example, the partition `mongodb-mongo-master/2022-12-05` would contain the daily aggregated test stats for all tests run on `2022-12-05` in the `mongodb-mongo-master` project. When running queries against this view it is highly recommended to always filter by project and date.

### Evergreen AWS Task Costs

Cost of finished Evergreen tasks that ran on AWS infrastructure, partitioned by the project and date (in ISO format). For example, the partition `mongodb-mongo-master/2023-12-05` would contain all tasks that completed on `2023-12-05` in the `mongodb-mongo-master` project. When running queries against this view it is highly recommended to always filter by project and date.

Note that this is an estimated cost based solely on compute (`BoxUsage`) usage per task. These cost estimations are calculated using the discounted AWS cost report data and the finished task data, namely the task's host ID and start and finish times. The cost estimation does not include additional spend that the task may incur, including EBS usage, data transfer, and additional compute from hosts spawned via the `create.host` command.

### Example Queries

Query all the test statistics for a given project on a given day:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM awsdatacatalog.dev_prod_live.v__results__daily_test_stats__v1
WHERE project = '<project_id>'
AND   task_create_iso = '<YYYY-DD-MM>'
```

Aggregate test statistics for mainline commits across the past two weeks for a given project, variant, and task:

```sql
SELECT test_name                    AS "test_name",
       SUM(num_pass)                AS "num_pass",
       SUM(num_fail)                AS "num_fail",
       SUM(total_pass_duration_ns)  AS "total_pass_duration_ns"
FROM awsdatacatalog.dev_prod_live.v__results__daily_test_stats__v1
WHERE project = '<project_id>'
AND   variant = '<variant>'
AND   task_name = '<task_name>'
AND   request_type = 'gitter_request'
AND   task_create_iso BETWEEN TO_ISO8601(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '15' DAY) AND TO_ISO8601(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' DAY)
GROUP BY 1
```

Get the average statistics of mainline tests per day per variant and task for a given project over the past two weeks, sorted by average number of failing tests per day in descending order:

```sql
SELECT variant                      AS "variant",
       task_name                    AS "task_name",
       AVG(num_pass)                AS "avg_num_pass",
       AVG(num_fail)                AS "avg_num_fail",
       AVG(total_pass_duration_ns)  AS "avg_total_pass_duration_ns"
FROM awsdatacatalog.dev_prod_live.v__results__daily_test_stats__v1
WHERE project = '<project_id>'
AND   request_type = 'gitter_request'
AND   task_create_iso BETWEEN TO_ISO8601(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '15' DAY) AND TO_ISO8601(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
