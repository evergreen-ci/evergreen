# Spawn Hosts

If a test fails on a platform other than the one you develop on locally, you'll likely want to get access to a machine of that type in order to investigate the source of the failure. You can accomplish this using the spawn hosts feature of evergreen.

## Troubleshooting connecting to a spawn host

If you are having trouble connecting to a spawn host:

- Make sure you are connected to the MongoDB network or VPN.
- Verify the host is in the "RUNNING" state and the DNS host name for the spawn host is correct. Note that if you pause and then start the host, it will get a new DNS name.
- Verify you are using the correct user. This can be found on the [My Hosts](https://spruce.mongodb.com/spawn/host) page under the Spawn Host detail drop down.
- Verify you are using the correct ssh key used when creating the Spawn Host. Use the -i argument to specify the location of your local private ssh key to use.
- Newer versions of macOS do not by default support older SSH algorithms. Please add these lines to the `Host *` stanza of your ~/.ssh/config:

```
  Host *
      HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
      PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
```

## Making a distro "spawnable"

Evergreen administrators can choose to make a distro available to users for spawning by checking the box on the distro configuration panel labeled _"Allow users to spawn these hosts for personal use"_

Only distros backed by a provider that supports dynamically spinning up new hosts (static hosts, of course, do not) allow this option.

## Spawning a Host

Visit `/spawn` to view the spawn hosts control panel. Click on "Spawn Host" and choose the distro you want to spawn, and choose the key you'd like to use (or provide a new one).

## Spawning a Host From a Task

Alternately, for a task that ran on a distro where spawning is enabled, you will see a "Spawn..." or "Spawn Host" link on its task page.

![task_page_spawn_host.png](../images/task_page_spawn_host.png)

Clicking it will pre-populate the spawn host page with a request to spawn a host of that distro, along with the option to fetch binaries and artifacts associated with the task and any tasks that it depended on.

![spawn_host_modal.png](../images/spawn_host_modal.png)

Fetching artifacts can also be performed manually; see [fetch](../CLI#fetch) in the Evergreen command line tool documentation.

Artifacts are placed in /data/mci. Note that you will likely be able to ssh into the host before the artifacts are finished fetching.

If your project has a project setup script defined at the admin level, you can also check "Use project-specific setup script defined at ..." before creating the spawn host. You can check if there are errors fetching artifacts or running this script on the host page: `https://spruce.mongodb.com/host/<host_id>`.

EC2 spawn hosts can be stopped/started and modified from the Spawn Host page, or via the command line, which is documented in [Basic Host Usage](../CLI#basic-host-usage) in the Evergreen command line tool documentation.

## Spawn Host Expiration

By default, spawn hosts expire after one week. This expiration can be set (or the host can be made unexpirable) when
spawning the host or can be set later by pressing the "edit" button for the host. You can extend an expirable host's
lifetime up to 30 days past host creation.

If you'd like to get a notification before a host expires, you can [set up a
notification](../Project-Configuration/Notifications#spawn-host-expiration) for it.

## Unexpirable Host Sleep Schedules

Evergreen has introduced a new feature for unexpirable hosts called host sleep schedules, which allow you to control
when you'd like your unexpirable host to be automatically turned on or off. A sleep schedule lets you choose recurring
times of the week when you want your host to be on, and when it's okay for it to be turned off. For example, you could
set a sleep schedule where your host is up and running during your work hours from 10 am to 6 pm between Monday and
Friday and otherwise let it turn it off overnight and during weekends. Setting a sleep schedule ensures your host is on
during your working hours, while also stopping the host when it's not being actively used. Powering down hosts when
they're not being used is important to ensure that hosts are being efficiently utilized and to avoid over-spending on
idle long-lived hosts.

**While this feature is being rolled out, please [choose and complete one of the three options](#beta-testing) for your
unexpirable host(s). You must complete one of the options before the beta test ends at 11 am (Eastern Time) on Tuesday
September 3. If you do not take any action, a default schedule will be set on your behalf for your unexpirable host(s)
at the end of the beta test period.**

### ***Important Note***: This Feature is in Beta Testing! {#beta-testing}

**This feature is currently available for beta testing until September 3.** While it's in beta testing, _using
the sleep schedule is an opt-in feature_. During this beta testing period, you have the following options to choose from
for your host, **please pick and complete one before the beta test period ends**:

1. [Option 1](#sleep-schedule) (Recommended for most users): Set a sleep schedule for each of your existing
   unexpirable hosts on by [pressing the "edit" button on the spawn host page](https://spruce.mongodb.com/spawn/host).
   After choosing a sleep schedule, it's also recommended (but not required) that you check the option to participate in
   the sleep schedule beta test.
2. [Option 2](#host-auto-sleep-script): Set up a local script on your host to automatically stop/start your host based
   on your own activity within the host. This is a separate but accepted alternative to the sleep schedule.
3. [Option 3](#permanent-exemption): If you have a special reason that your host cannot use 1 or 2, you
   can request a permanent exemption for your host.

**The beta test period will end on September 3, at which point the sleep schedule will stop being an opt-in
feature and will take effect on _all_ unexpirable hosts except those that have been granted a permanent exemption, so
please make sure to complete one of the options above**. If you do not do any of the three options, a default sleep
schedule will be automatically set for your unexpirable host when the beta test ends - the default is that the host will
be set to a schedule where it'll be running 8am-8pm Mon-Fri in the time zone you've set in your Spruce preferences.
Furthermore, if you have a host that's stopped and don't pick any sleep schedule for it by the end of the beta test
period, it will still be assigned a sleep schedule. In addition, those hosts will be be [kept off](#keeping-a-host-off).
Once you manually turn the host back on, the sleep schedule will begin taking effect.

### Option 1: Sleep Schedule {#sleep-schedule}

This is the new feature described [above](#unexpirable-host-sleep-schedules) to set times of the week when you want your
host to be on or off. You can set a recurring sleep schedule on your host from [the
UI](https://spruce.mongodb.com/spawn/host) by pressing the "edit" button your host.

In the Spruce UI, you can pick a sleep schedule for your host when creating the unexpirable host or editing an existing
unexpirable host:

![Sleep schedule](../images/set_sleep_schedule.png)

The example sleep schedule above will automatically turn the host on from 8am to 8pm on Monday to Friday (Eastern Time).
The host will be automatically turned off overnight from 8pm to 8am on Monday to Friday, and will be off for the entire
weekend.

From the create/edit host modal, you can pick which days you'd like the host to be on, and the time that you want your
host to be on for those days. The time zone for the host sleep schedule will be based on the time zone you choose in
your [Spruce preferences](https://spruce.mongodb.com/preferences/profile). You can edit this schedule whenever you want.

When setting a sleep schedule in the UI, you also have the option to participate in the beta test. If you opt into the
beta test, the sleep schedule that you set will take effect on your host, stopping and starting your host according to
the schedule you configure; if you do not opt in, your sleep schedule will be set but will have no effect on your host
during the beta test period (i.e. until September 3). You can opt in or out freely during the beta test for this
feature. **It's highly recommend that when you set a sleep schedule for your unexpirable host(s), you also opt into the
beta test to verify that your sleep schedule is working the way you want.**

#### Temporary Exemptions

If you need your host to temporarily ignore its sleep schedule, you can request a temporary exemption for your host.
During a temporary exemption, the sleep schedule will not take effect at all, so Evergreen will not stop/start your host
unless you stop/start it manually. This is useful if you have a one-off need to keep your host on without interruption.
For example, if you're running a test overnight on the host and you don't want the host to be stopped, you can request a
temporary exemption until tomorrow to keep the host on. Another example is if it's outside your working hours (and the
host has already automatically stopped for the night for its sleep schedule) but you want to check a file in your host,
you can request a temporary exemption and then turn your host on. The sleep schedule will let your host stay on, and
will ignore the host's sleep schedule until the temporary exemption ends.

You can set a temporary exemption in the Spruce edit host modal:

![Temporary exemption](../images/sleep_schedule_temporary_exemption.png)

Alternatively, you can set a temporary exemption from the CLI:

```sh
evergreen host modify --host <HOST_ID> --extend-temporary-exemption <NUM_HOURS>
```

You can temporarily exempt your host from the sleep schedule for up to a month from today.

#### Keeping a Host Off

Your host's sleep schedule will regularly stop and start your host. However, there can be some use cases where you may
wish to turn your host off for an extended period of time. For example, if you are about to go on leave, you may wish to
leave your host off for the entire time since you won't need it.

To accommodate this, Evergreen offers an option to keeping the host off until the next time you start it back up
yourself. If you choose this option, Evergreen will let the host will remain off and will not start or stop your host
automatically for its sleep schedule. The sleep schedule will only take effect again when you start the host back up
manually.

If you'd like to manually turn off your host and keep it off until the next time you start it back up, you can press
pause on the host and check the option to keep the host off:

![Stop the host and keep off](../images/stop_host_keep_off.png)

This can also be done through the CLI:

```sh
evergreen host stop --host <host_id> --keep-off
```

#### FAQ

**Q: Can I still manually stop and start my hosts if the schedule is running?**
A: Yes! Even though Evergreen will automatically stop and start your host on the configured schedule, you can still
manually stop and start your host whenever you need to. If you do this, it's recommended, you also [set a temporary
exemption](#temporary-exemptions) to ensure that you can use your host without being accidentally interrupted when the
sleep schedule tries to automatically stop/start your host.

**Q: Will the hostname change between restarts?**

A: You can get a hostname that doesn't change from your unexpirable host. While it's true that EC2 hosts typically do
change their DNS names every time the host restarts, Evergreen automatically assigns persistent DNS names to unexpirable
hosts. This persistent DNS name will let you use to a single, stable name to refer to your host even if it restarts. You
can view your host's persistent DNS name by copying the SSH command from the host page or by running `evergreen host list --mine`.

Once you have your persistent DNS name, you can use it in your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`). For example:

```sshconfig
Host <your_persistent_dns_name>
    User <ssh_username>
    Hostname <your_persistent_dns_name>
```

### Option 2: Host Auto-Sleep Script {#host-auto-sleep-script}

The [host sleep script](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/host-sleep-script) is a standalone script-based option available
to users that can be used alongside (or as a substitute for) the sleep schedule feature. The main benefit of the script
over using the sleep schedule feature is that it will stop your host based on whether it detects activity in the host
(such as active SSH sessions), rather than stopping and starting on a recurring weekly schedule. It will automatically
turn off your host once there is no activity detected in it for some time. Later on, when you SSH into the host, it uses
a proxy script on your local computer to turn it back on and SSH into your host.

In order to use it, you must install the script into your local computer and unexpirable host by following the
instructions in [this repo](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/host-sleep-script).

***Caution: Use At Your Own Risk!***
* This is not an Evergreen feature. It modifies your local computer SSH configuration and your unexpirable host's
  systemd configuration to automatically start and stop the host.
* The script may have bugs. It has been tested in only a handful of setups.
* It may not work exactly as you'd like for your use case.

If you choose to use the host sleep script, Evergreen can only provide limited assistance and is not responsible for
debugging your setup. You're highly advised to read over the script and understand how it works before installing it.

#### Requesting a Permanent Exemption with the Auto-Sleep Script

Since the host auto-sleep script is a purely user-side script, the sleep schedule will still take effect alongside the
auto-sleep script you've installed on your host. If you'd like to use the host sleep script _as a replacement_ for the
Evergreen sleep schedule feature, you can [request a permanent exemption](#permanent-exemption). In the
permanent exemption request, please:
* Include the host ID.
* Mention that you're using the host auto-sleep script instead of the sleep schedule.
* Provide a text snippet of the script output.
* Show an example in your host's event logs where the host sleep script successfully stopped your host due to
  inactivity.

---

### Option 3: Requesting a Permanent Exemption {#permanent-exemption}

If for some reason your host cannot use a sleep schedule at all, you can request that your host be permanently exempt
from the sleep schedule feature. If your host is permanently exempt, it won't have any sleep schedule set and Evergreen
will not stop/start your host according to a recurring sleep schedule. A permanent exemption from setting a sleep
schedule would allow your host to be kept on 24/7.

**Requesting a permanent exemption is not recommended unless you have set up [the auto-sleep
script](#host-auto-sleep-script) (and want it to substitute for a recurring sleep schedule) or you have a particular
reason that your host must be kept on at all times.** This is because keeping hosts on 24/7 is not an efficient use of
AWS resources since the host incurs costs to run while it's not being actively used. In addition, users who only
occasionally need their host to be kept on for an extended period of time can set [temporary
exemptions](#temporary-exemptions) when needed.

If you'd like to request a permanent exemption, please file a DEVPROD ticket with the title "Permanent Exemption
Request" and set Evergreen App as the Dev Prod service. In it, please include your host ID and an explanation of why
you'd like your host to be permanently exempt from the sleep schedule (and if relevant, why the other options are not
suitable for your usage).

If you're using the host auto-sleep script as a replacement for the sleep schedule and would like to get a permanent
exemption for the host, please follow the instructions
[here](#requesting-a-permanent-exemption-with-the-auto-sleep-script).

## Hosts Page

The Spruce hosts page offers three batch actions applicable to hosts:

1. Update Status

   You can force a state change to these statuses:

   - Decommissioned: Terminate a host after it's done running its current task.
   - Quarantined: Stop a host from running tasks without terminating it or shutting it down. This is to do ops work on it like temporary maintenance, debugging, etc. Once the maintenance is done, it's usually set back to running to pick up tasks like normal. Quarantined is used almost exclusively for static hosts.
   - Terminate: Shut down the host.
   - Stopped: Stop the host.
   - Running: Start the host.

2. Restart Jasper

   This option will try forcing the Evergreen agent (which runs in a system process called Jasper) to start back up in a way that's less disruptive than just rebooting the host.

3. Reprovision

   Hosts need to have a few starter files on the file system before they can run tasks. Sometimes static hosts can get into bad states (e.g. the file system is corrupted) and stop functioning correctly. Reprovisioning a host will repopulate these files for static hosts.
