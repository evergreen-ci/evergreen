# REST v2 API

Base URL: `http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/`

## General Functionality

### A note on authentication

Many of the these REST endpoints do not require authentication to
access, but some do. These will return a 404 if no authentication
headers are sent, if the username is invalid, or if the API key is
incorrect. Use the `user` and `api_key` fields from the
[settings](https://spruce.mongodb.com/preferences/cli) page to set two headers,
`Api-User` and `Api-Key`.

### Content Type and Communication

The API accepts and returns all results in JSON. Some resources also
allow URL parameters to provide additional specificity to a request.

### Errors

When an error is encountered during a request, the API returns a JSON
object with the HTTP status code and a message describing the error of
the form:

    {
     "status": <http_status_code>,
     "error": <error message>
    }

### Pagination

API Routes that fetch many objects return them in a JSON array and
support paging through subsets of the total result set. When there are
additional results for the query, access to them is populated in a [Link
HTTP header](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader). This header has the
form:

    "Link" : <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="next"

    <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="prev"

### Dates

Date fields are returned and accepted in ISO-8601 UTC extended format.
They contain 3 fractional seconds with a 'dot' separator.

### Empty Fields

A returned object will always contain its complete list of fields. Any
field that does not have an associated value will be filled with JSON's
null value.

## Resources

The API has a series of implemented objects that it returns depending on
the queried endpoint.

### Task

The task is a basic unit of work understood by Evergreen. They usually
comprise a suite of tests or generation of a set of artifacts.

    POST /patches/<patch_id>/abort

Aborts a single patch using its ID and returns the patch

##### Configure/Schedule a Patch

    POST /patches/<patch_id>/configure  

Update the list of tasks that the specified patch will run. This works both for initially specifying a patch's tasks, as well as for adding additional tasks to an already-scheduled patch.  The request body should be in the following format: 

    {
      "description": "this is my patch",
          "variants": [
          {
                 "id": "variant-1",
                        "tasks": ["task1", task2"]
                            },
          {
                 "id": "variant-2",
                        "tasks": ["task2", task3"]
                            }
                              ]
                              }"]

| variants    | array of variant objects | Required, these are the variants and tasks that the patch should run. |

Each variant object is of the format { "variant": "\<variant name\>", "tasks": ["task name"] }. This field is analogous in syntax and usage to the "buildvariants" field in the project's evergreen.yml file. Names of display tasks can be specified in the tasks array and will work as one would expect. For an already-scheduled patch, any new tasks in this array will be created, and any existing tasks not in this array will be unscheduled.

annotation settings, workstation settings, and container secrets) is omitted.

**Parameters**

| Name     | Type   | Description                                                                             |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| start_at | string | Optional. The id of the project to start at in the pagination. Defaults to empty string |
| limit    | int    | Optional. The number of projects to be returned per page of pagination. Defaults to 100 |


##### Get A Project

    GET /projects/<project_id>

Returns the project (restricted to project admins). Includes public
variables, aliases, and subscriptions. Note that private variables are
*always redacted.* If you want to use this to copy project variables,
see instead the "Copy Project Variables" route.

**Parameters**

| Name                 | Type | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| includeRepo          | bool | Optional. Setting to true will return the merged result of project and repo level settings. Defaults to false                               |
| includeProjectConfig | bool | Optional. Setting to true will return the merged result of the project and the config properties set in the project YAML. Defaults to false |


##### Modify A Project

    PATCH /projects/<project_id>

Modify an existing project (restricted to project admins). Will enable webhooks 
if an enabled project, and enable PR testing and the commit queue if specified. 

For lists, if there is a complementary
"delete" field, then the former field indicates items to be added,
while the "delete" field indicates items to be deleted. Otherwise, the
given list will overwrite the original list (the only exception is for project
variables -- we will ignore any empty project variables to avoid accidentally 
overwriting private variables).

##### Copy a Project 

    POST /projects/<project_id>/copy?new_project=<new_project_id>

Restricted to admins of the original project. Create a new project that
is identical to indicated project\--this project is initially disabled
(PR testing and CommitQueue also initially disabled). The unique
identifier is passed to the query parameter `new_project` and is
required.

Project variables, aliases, and subscriptions also copied. Returns the
new project (but not variables/aliases/subscriptions).

##### Copy Variables to an Existing Project

    POST /projects/<source_project>/copy/variables

Restricted to admins of the source project/repo and the destination
project/repo. Copies variables from projectA to projectB.

**CopyVariablesOptions**

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| copy_to         | string | Required. ProjectID to copy `source_project` variables to.                                                                        |
| include_private | bool   | If set to true, private variables will also be copied.                                                                            |
| overwrite       | bool   | If set to true, will remove variables from the `copy_to` project that are not in `source_project`.                                |
| dry_run         | bool   | If set to true, route returns the variables from `source_project` that will be copied. (If private, the values will be redacted.) |


If `dry_run` is set, then the route does not complete the copy, but
returns OK if no project variables in the source project will be
overwritten (this concerns [all]{.title-ref} variables in the
destination project, but only redacted variables in the source project).
Otherwise, an error is given which includes the project variable keys
that overlap.

if `dry_run` is not set, the copy is completed, and variables could be
overwritten.

##### Get Versions For A Project

    GET /projects/<project_id>/versions

Returns a paginated list of recent versions for a project. Parameters
should be passed into the JSON body (the route still accepts limit and
start as query parameters to support legacy behavior).

**Parameters**

If the user has no public keys, expect: []

##### Add a Public Key to the Current User

    POST /keys

Add a single public key to the current user (as determined by the
Api-User and Api-Key headers) as a Key object. If you attempt to insert
a key with a duplicate name, it will fail

Both name and key must not be empty strings, nor strings consisting
entirely of whitespace

If the key was successfully inserted, the server will return HTTP status
code 200 OK

If the a key with the supplied name already exists, the key will not be
added, and the route will return status code 400 Bad Request.

Any other status code indicates that the key was not successfully added.

#### TaskReliability 

Task Reliability success scores are aggregated task execution statistics for a given project. Statistics can be grouped by time period (days) and by task, variant, distro combinations.  The score is based on the lower bound value of a `Binomial proportion confidence interval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval>`_.  In this case, the equation is a `Wilson score interval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson%20score%20interval%20with%20continuity%20correction>`_:  |Wilson score interval with continuity correction|   In statistics, a binomial proportion confidence interval is a confidence interval for the probability of success calculated from the outcome of a series of success–failure experiments (Bernoulli trials). In other words, a binomial proportion confidence interval is an interval estimate of a success probability p when only the number of experiments n and the number of successes nS are known.  The advantage of using a confidence interval of this sort is that the computed value takes the number of test into account. The lower the number of test, the greater the margin of error. This results in a lower success rate score for the cases where there are fewer test results.  During the evaluation of this algorithm, 22 consecutive test passes are required before a success  score of .85 is reached (with a significance level / α of ``0.05`).

#### Endpoints

    POST /notifications/<type>

The type can be "email" or "slack".

### Permissions

    GET /permissions

Returns a static list of project and distro permissions that can be
granted to users. The format is :

    {
       projectPermissions: [
         {
           key: "permission_key",
           name: "My Permission",
           levels: [
             {
               description: "Edit this permission",
               value: 10,
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     distroPermissions:[

               value: 10,
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
    }

### Users

#### Endpoints

Give Permissions to User

    POST /users/<user_id>/permissions  Grants the user specified by user_id the permissions in the request body. 

Note that usage of this endpoint requires that the requesting user have security to modify roles. The format of the body is : 
```
{
      "resource_type": "project",
      "resources": ["project1", "project2"],
      "permissions": {
         "project_tasks: 30,
         "project_patches": 10
      }
}
```

* resource_type - the type of resources for which permission is granted. Must be one of "project", "distro", or "superuser" 
* resources - an array of strings representing what resources the access is for. For a resource_type of project, this will be a list of projects. For a resource_type of distro, this will be a list of distros. 
* permissions - an object whose keys are the permission keys returned by the /permissions endpoint above, and whose values are the levels of access to grant for that permission (also returned by the /permissions endpoint)  

Get User Permissions

    GET /users/<user_id>/permissions

**Parameters**

| Name | Type    | Description                                                      |
|------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| all  | Boolean | Optional. If included, we will not filter out basic permissions. |


Retrieves all permissions for the user (ignoring basic permissions that
are given to all users, unless all=true is included). The format of the
response is :
```
[ {
 "type": "project",
 "permissions": {
    "project1": { "project_tasks": 30, "project_patches": 10 },
    "project2": { "project_tasks": 10, "project_patches": 10 } }
 } 
 {
 "type": "distro",
 "permissions": { "distro1": {"distro_settings": 10 } } 
  } ]
```

-   type - the type of resources for which the listed permissions apply.
    Will be "project", "distro", or "superuser"
-   permissions - an object whose keys are the resources for which the
    user has permissions. Note that these objects will often have many
    keys, since logged-in users have basic permissions to every project
    and distro. The values in the keys are objects representing the
    permissions that the user has for that resource, identical to the
    format of the permissions field in the POST
    /users/\<user_id\>/permissions API.

Get All User Permissions For Resource

    GET /users/permissions  

Retrieves all users with permissions for the resource, and their highest permissions, and returns this as a mapping. This ignores basic permissions that are given to all users.  

The format of the body is: 

    {
      "resource_type": "project",
        "resources": ["project1", "project2"],
        "permissions": {
             "project_tasks: 30,
                  "project_patches": 10
                    }
                    }"
        }
    }

##### Delete User Permissions ``````````\`

    DELETE /users/<user_id>/permissions

Deletes all permissions of a given type for a user by deleting their
roles of that type for that resource ID. This ignores the Basic
Project/Distro Access that is given to all MongoDB employees.

Note that usage of this endpoint requires that the requesting user have
security to modify roles. The format of the body is: :

    {
      "resource_type": "project",
      "resource_id": "project_id", 
    }

-   resource_type - the type of resources for which to delete
    permissions. Must be one of "project", "distro", "superuser",
    or "all". "all" will revoke all permissions for the user.
-   resource_id - the resource ID for which to delete permissions.
    Required unless deleting all permissions.

##### Get Users for Role

    GET /roles/<role_id>/users

Gets a list of users for the specified role. The format of the response
is:
```json
{ "users": ["list", "of", "users"] }
```

##### Give Roles to User

    POST /users/<user_id>/roles

Adds the specified roles to the specified user. Attempting to add a
duplicate role will result in an error. If you're unsure of what roles
you want to add, you probably want to POST To /users/user_id/permissions
instead. Note that usage of this endpoint requires that the requesting
user have security to modify roles. The format of the body is: :

    {
      "roles": [ "role1", "role2" ],
      "create_user": true,
    }

-   roles - the list of roles to add for the user
-   create_user - if true, will also create a shell user document for
    the user. By default, specifying a user that does not exist will
    error

##### Offboard User

    POST /users/offboard_user

Marks unexpirable volumes and hosts as expirable for the user, and
removes the user as a project admin for any projects, if applicable.
This returns the IDs of the hosts/volumes that were unexpirable and
modified.

This route expects to receive the user in a json body with the following
format: :

    {
      "email": "my_user@email.com"
    }

-   email - the email of the user

The format of the response is: :

    {
      "terminated_hosts": [ "i-12345", "i-abcd" ],
      "terminated_volumes": ["volume-1"],
    }

**Query Parameters**

| Name    | Type | Description                                                                          |
|---------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dry_run | bool | If set to true, route returns the IDs of the hosts/volumes that *would* be modified. |

## REST V2 Use Case Guide

### Find all failures of a given build

#### Endpoint

`GET /builds/<build_id>/tasks`

#### Description

To better understand the state of a build, perhaps when attempting to
determine the quality of a build for a release, it is helpful to be able
to fetch information about the tasks it ran. To fetch this data, make a
call to the `GET /builds/<build_id>/tasks` endpoint. Page through the
results task data to produce meaningful statistics like the number of
task failures or percentage of failures of a given build.

## Find detailed information about the status of a particular tasks and its tests

### Endpoints

`GET /tasks/<task_id>`

`GET /tasks/<task_id>/tests`

#### Description

To better understand all aspects of a task failure, such as failure
mode, which tests failed, and how long it took, it is helpful to fetch
this information about a task. This can be accomplished using 2 API
calls. Make one call to the endpoint for a specific task
`GET /tasks/<task_id>` which returns information about the task itself.
Then, make a second cal to `GET /tasks/<task_id>/tests` which delivers
specific information about the tests that ran in a certain task.

### Get all hosts

#### Endpoint

`GET /hosts`

#### Description

Retrieving information on Evergreen's hosts can be helpful for system
monitoring. To fetch this information, make a call to `GET /hosts`,
which returns a paginated list of hosts. Page through the results to
inspect all hosts.

By default, this endpoint will only return hosts that are considered
"up" (status is equal to running, initializing, starting,
provisioning, or provision failed).

### Restart all failures for a commit

#### Endpoints

`GET /project/<project_name>/revisions/<commit_hash>/tasks`

`POST /tasks/<task_id>/restart`

#### Description

Some Evergreen projects contain flaky tests or can endure spurious
failures. To restart all of these tasks to gain better signal a user can
fetch all of the tasks for a commit. Make a request to
`GET /project/<project_name>/revisions/<commit_hash>/tasks` to fetch the
tasks that ran and then loop over all of the returned tasks, calling
`POST /tasks/<task_id>/restart` on each task which has failed.

### Modify an Existing Project

#### Endpoint

`PATCH /projects/<project_id>`

#### Description

To modify the project, make a request to the endpoint with a JSON object
as the body (using the project object descriptions on the REST V2 Usage
wiki page). The result of a successful PATCH will be a 200 status. To
see the modified project, make a request to
`GET /projects/<project_id>`.

For example, to enable the commit queue the body would be:

    { "commit_queue": 
      { "enabled": "true" } 
    }

To add and delete admins:

    { "admins": ["annie.black", "brian.samek"], // does not overwrite existing admins    
      "delete_admins": ["john.liu"] // deletes existing admin }

To add/delete variables and specify which are private:

    { "variables": 
      { "vars": { // add to existing variables
        "banana": "yellow",             
        "apple": "red", },         
      "private_vars": { "apple": "true", // this cannot be undone         
      },         
      "vars_to_delete": ["watermelon"] }}

### Copy an Existing Project

#### Endpoint

`POST /projects/<project_id>/copy`

#### Description

To copy a project to a new project, this is the route you would use. To
define the new project's name (which is required), we would include a
query parameter, for example:

    projects/my_first_project/copy?new_project=my_second_project

This route will return the new project but this will not include
variables/aliases/subscriptions; to see this, GET the new project.
