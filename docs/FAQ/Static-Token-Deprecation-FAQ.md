# Static Token Deprecation FAQ

## What is being deprecated?

We will transition over to using personal access tokens for all human users instead of the static api keys we have been using and downloading from [preferences/cli](https://spruce.mongodb.com/preferences/cli) until now.

## When will static tokens be deprecated?

For updates on this migration, please see [DEVPROD-4160](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DEVPROD-4160). This work is currently paused as we are working towards integrating kanopy-oidc into Evergreen.

## What does this affect?

- **UI**: No Changes
  - You will be able to continue using the Evergreen and Spruce UI without any changes.
- **CLI**: Action Needed
  - Until now, you were able to use a static API key saved to a `~/.evergreen.yml` file. This will no longer be accepted after the transition. Please see [here](../CLI.md#authentication).
- **REST API**: Action Needed for Scripting with Human Users
  - **Using the REST API in the browser**: Not affected.
  - **Using the REST API with a service user**: Not affected (e.g., calling it with a service user in scripts that run in Evergreen tasks).
  - **Using the REST API with a human user**: Affected. Please see [here](../API/REST-V1-Usage#authentication).

## I use the Evergreen CLI, what should I do to prepare for the deprecation?

- No action is necessary for now. We will let users know once kanopy-oidc is available through evergreeen.

## I own a script that is used by manual users that uses the Evergreen api, what should I do to prepare for the deprecation?

- Switch your script to use evergreen.mongodb.com for service users along with the headers specified [here](../API/REST-V1-Usage#static-api-keys), and evergreen.corp.mongodb.com for non service users with the headers specified [here](<https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/spaces/DBDEVPROD/pages/384992097/Kanopy+Auth+On+Evergreen#KanopyAuthOnEvergreen-RESTAPI(V1andV2)>).
- We are working on providing a CLI command that will make it easier for scripts that rely on the .evergreen.yml config file. Please follow [DEVPROD-17996](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DEVPROD-17996) for updates.

## I am using a static Evergreen API key in an Evergreen task, will this continue to work?

If the API key belongs to a [service user](../Project-Configuration/Project-and-Distro-Settings#service-users) it will continue to work as expected. If it belongs to a human user, please reach out to the evergreen team to have a service user created for you.

## Will spawn hosts be affected?

Yes, to use the evergreen CLI on a spawn host, you will need to copy/paste the link provided into your laptop's browser when prompted. You will not need to do any other additional setup.

## How often will I be asked to click on a link to authenticate?

Please see [here](https://kanopy.corp.mongodb.com/docs/corpsecure/auth_flow/#refresh-token).

## Why am I being asked to copy and paste a link instead of the link being opened in a browser automatically?

We implemented it this way so that it is compatible with spawn hosts.

## Why did I have to wait a while for the CLI command to load after authenticating?

Due to a polling interval backoff, the longer it takes for a user to click on the link to authenticate, the longer it will take to load. Luckily, this doesn't apply to refreshes which are almost instant.
