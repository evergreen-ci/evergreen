### Task tabs

#### Tasks
The Tasks tab contains a table of all of the tasks that ran in the version. 

The table is comprised of the following columns:
* The Task name and a link to the [task page](Task). 
* The Task status. 
* The Base Task status. For mainline commits this is the status of the task on the previous commit. For Patches this is the status of the task on the base commit.
* The Build Variant the task ran on.

#### Task Duration
The Task Duration tab contains a list of all of the tasks that ran in the version and how long they took to run.
