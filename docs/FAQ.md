##### What is the difference between cron, batchtime, and periodic build?

The main difference is that cron and batchtime are tied to activating builds for existing commits and periodic builds creates new builds on a schedule regardless of commit activity. For more on their differences and examples, see [controlling when tasks run](Project-Configuration/Controlling-when-tasks-run).
