# Evergreen Limits

Evergreen has different kinds of limits in place. The ones that users are likely to encounter are listed here.

## Never Expiring Hosts

Evergreen limits users to two never expiring spawn hosts at a time.

#### Can an exception be requested?

Exceptions can be requested on a case-by-case which will be granted based on [our policy](https://mongodb.stackenterprise.co/questions/1122).

## Task Limits

Evergreen limits tasks per version to 40,000. This includes both selected and unselected tasks. 

## Task Timeout Max

Evergreen does not have a limit on how large task timeouts can be. For different default timeouts that evergreen has in place, see [pre and post](../Project-Configuration/Project-Configuration-Files/#pre-and-post) and [timout handler](../Project-Configuration/Project-Configuration-Files/#timeout-handler).

## Include Limits

There is an [investigation](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DEVPROD-3509) to figure out how many include files we want to let users put in their project configuration. The current limit is 50.

## YAML configuration size

Large parser projects are disabled, which means that Evergreen limits YAML project configuration sizes to 16MB.
The 16 MB limit is on the sum of the size of the generate.tasks input file and the size of the project configuration YAML. If the YAML length > 16 MB after task generators have tacked on their configuration to the project configuration YAML, the task will fail.

#### Can an exception be requested?

This cannot be lifted because Evergreen cannot safely handle larger file sizes from multiple users. Users are encouraged to instead try creating a new patch with fewer variants/tasks.

## Patch size

Evergreen has a 100MB system limit on patch size (the diff size for the changes). In order to submit patches that are larger than 16MB from the CLI, the `--large` flag needs to be used. Large patches may hit the CLIâ€™s one minute timeout. To work around that, users can open a PR and run the patch from there.

## What is the largest file size I can upload to Parsley?

Evergreen does not have a limit for Parsley file sizes. However, you will encounter a limit based on the browser that you are using. As of April 4, 2022 the limits are:

In V8 (used by Chrome and Node), the maximum length is 229 - 24 (~1GiB). On 32-bit systems, the maximum length is 228 - 16 (~512MiB). In Firefox, the maximum length is 230 - 2 (~2GiB). Before Firefox 65, the maximum length was 228 - 1 (~512MiB). In Safari, the maximum length is 231 - 1 (~4GiB).
