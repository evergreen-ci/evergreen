# Evergreen Ecosystem

This is a list of libraries which Evergreen depends on and other tools and services
which Evergreen tasks may use or interact with.

## From Other CI Systems

You can start an Evergreen patch from other CI systems.

- [evergreen-ci/action](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/action) for GitHub Actions
- [evergreen-ci/drone](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/drone/) for Drone.

## Applications (Go)

- [barque](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/barque) is a service that supports release
  focusing initially on linux repository publishing, and eventually package signing,
  release metadata and process automation.
- [cedar](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/cedar) is collection of data-focused
  tools for the data generated by Evergreen builds. Its focus is offline data
  processing and providing access for tools like CLIs and visualization. Cedar,
  like evergreen, is a web service, and shares many of the same underlying
  libraries and architectures.
- [curator](https://github.com/mongodb/curator) is a command-line tool we use to
  generate package repositories and build packages. It hosts command-line tools
  versioned independently of Evergreen, including poplar (sending and collecting
  performance data), and jasper (managing processes), and grip (sending logs to
  logkeeper, splunk, or cedar).
- [evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen) is the continuous
  integration system at the center of this ecosystem.
- [logkeeper](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/logkeeper) is a service for
  storing test logs in a MongoDB database.

## Libraries (Go)

- [amboy](https://github.com/mongodb/amboy) provides distributed worker queues.
  In Evergreen the unit work on runs in these queues is called a job in order to
  distinguish it from a task, which is a unit of work in an Evergreen project.
  Jobs are not visible to users, but they accomplish most of the work necessary
  for Evergreen to run, e.g., starting and provisioning hosts.
- [anser](https://github.com/mongodb/anser) is a data migration tool for managing
  schema evolution in MongoDB databases and Go applications. Relies on amboy
  for orchestration and ftdc/bsonx for bson manipulation. Additionally provides a
  compatibility layer for translating from the legacy mgo API to the new Go
  Driver interface.
- [aviation](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/aviation) is middleware for gRPC.
  It is similar to gimlet, Evergreen's HTTP middleware.
- [birch](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/birch) is a library for building and manipulating bson documents.
- [bond](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/bond) is a library to interact with MongoDB
  release feeds.
- [certdepot](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/certdepot) is a set of tools for
  creating and storing TLS certificates.
- [ftdc](https://github.com/mongodb/ftdc) is a library that provides a Go
  implementation for reading and generating compressed timeseries bson data
  in the same format as MongoDB's diagnostic data package. This library
  is used to capture and interact with performance data in Cedar and poplar.
- [gimlet](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/gimlet) is a library for creating
  HTTP APIs. This is Evergreen's HTTP middleware.
- [grip](https://github.com/mongodb/grip) is a library for logging and error
  handling. In addition to the things you would expect, it also implements
  senders to third-party services, like Splunk, which allows Evergreen to have
  pluggable logging to these services. Other logging/messaging back-ends
  include: logkeeper, sumologic, splunk, email, jira tickets, github comments.
- [jasper](https://github.com/mongodb/jasper) is a library for managing processes.
  This is used for executing processes on app servers as well as on hosts.
- [mrpc](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/mrpc) a mongodb rpc protocol implementation
  for producing arbitrary services that mongodb clients can use.
- [pail](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/pail) is a library for interacting
  with blob-storage systems like s3. Includes a common abstraction with
  implementations for GridFS and local file systems.
- [poplar](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/poplar) is a set of tools for
  recording performance results from an Evergreen task, and provides a common
  default implementation of a client for the performance data management
  service in Cedar.
- [shrub](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/shrub) is Go library for generating
  Evergreen configuration files.
- [spruce](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/spruce) is Evergreen's
  React-based UI.
- [parsley](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/parsley) is Evergreen's React-based log viewer.

## Libraries (Python, JS, Emacs)

- [evergreen.el](https://github.com/mongodb/evergreen.el) is an Emacs package for
  interacting with the Evergreen CLI.
- [evergreen.js](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen.js) is a JavaScript
  client library for Evergreen's API.
- [evergreen.py](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen.py) is a Python
  client library for Evergreen's API.
- [shrub.py](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/shrub.py) is a Python library for
  generating Evergreen configuration files.
